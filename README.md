<strong>Description</strong><br />
For coding help with my Codecademy UI project

<strong>About</strong><br />
This repository contains my working files for one of the UI projects with the Codecademy Intensive Pro: Building UIs course.<br />
It is for obtaining suggestions, corrections and coding help from my course-mates and facilitator.<br /><br />
No reproduction of my HTML & CSS code outside of the abovementioned context is allowed. 
While the basic bare-bones webpage content was produced by Codecademy, the styling and HTML structure and syntax are mine.
Kindly approach Codeademy to obtain the base template.
